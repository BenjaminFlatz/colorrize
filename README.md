# COLORRIZE

### Goal
Control multiple LED-Modules with this app in the local network

### Description
This is my exam project at the lbsfe1 in my apprenticeship as electronics technician. I built it to learn basic app development in Kotlin and connect this with my knowledge in electronics. Because I had no experience in app development this project was a learning experience for me.
This LED control app works with an ESP8266 Module the colors are transmitted via the rgb values in the url in addition you can add mode, frequency and brightness.
